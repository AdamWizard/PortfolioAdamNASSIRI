A Shoot'em up arcade game where you can convert enemies into friends

## A very personal project...
<p align="center"><img src="Big_Scary_Eye_Jitter.gif" /></p>
Friend-Ship is my current passion project, as a huge fan of the shmup genre,<br>
I wanted to try my hand at making one.

I have been working on this game for about 2 years in between classes, from the [playable demo](https://adam-wizard.itch.io/friend-ship-demo) i made to the project it has become today, we are currently working on it as "whiteboard", a team of 3 students as part of a class project at the **UQAC** (Université du Québec à Chicoutimi).

## And a challenge

Friend-Ship also proved to be a good challenge in terms of **game design, programming, and art**, the current project is being developped under the **Unity** engine, and we are working especially hard to ensure that our code allows as much freedom as possible in order to design exotic bullet patterns, ennemis, bosses etc.


#### My part of the work
Working on this game has forced me to develop new skills, namely in the art department, **all sprites in the game** so far (including the ennemies you can see on this page) were drawn and animated by me.

I was also responsible for setting up the **shooting system**, which is one of the very core parts of any shoot'em up game, the current version of our system allows for some freedom for creating patterns, as seen in the [early trailer](https://youtu.be/O5IPaBvK3d0) we made.

This project is still very much in its early stage, but so far it has proved to be both a fun project, and a learning opportunity.
