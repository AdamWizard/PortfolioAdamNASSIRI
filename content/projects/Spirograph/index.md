A program to visualize spirographs using C++ and SFML

## My first "game"

This program has some interactive features, although the actual building of the spirograph (the size and amount of discs) has to be done beforehand.

With this application, a user can setup their spirograph and watch it draw itself.
all necessary information to use the program is detailed in the **README.md** file on the [github repository](https://github.com/AdamWizard/Projet_Spirograph).

This project was made over the course of six months as a team of two students, it was my first experience with any kind of visual output software (we used **SFML** to render the shapes on a black screen).

I was in charge of defining and applying the mathematical equations that rule over the circular movement of the assembly, I deepened my mathematical skills, especially in the trigonometry department.

Since we had no prior information about the math of spirographs, a big part of this project was the **research** to figure out a model that would make sense mathematicaly, and be satisfying in terms of the aesthetics of the generated shapes.
