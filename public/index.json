It was also my first time using Perforce as a version control tool.\nThe result is althoug a bit unpolished, entirely playable.\nMy part of the work # Working on this project, I came to experience with drawing basic sprites and tiles.\nI was also responsible for developping the equipment system (the dagger, bow and shield that the player can use) and make it as flexible as possible to allow more tools to be added.\nFinaly, I acquired some level design experience by designing the puzzles of each room with my team.\n","date":"1 May 2023","permalink":"/projects/turquoise/","section":"Projects","summary":"2D Puzzle game with a timeloop mechanic","title":"A sacrifice for the turquoise lord"},{"content":"A program to visualize spirographs using C++ and SFML\nMy first \u0026ldquo;game\u0026rdquo; # This program has some interactive features, although the actual building of the spirograph (the size and amount of discs) has to be done beforehand.\nWith this application, a user can setup their spirograph and watch it draw itself. all necessary information to use the program is detailed in the README.md file on the github repository.\nThis project was made over the course of six months as a team of two students, it was my first experience with any kind of visual output software (we used SFML to render the shapes on a black screen).\nI was in charge of defining and applying the mathematical equations that rule over the circular movement of the assembly, I deepened my mathematical skills, especially in the trigonometry department.\nSince we had no prior information about the math of spirographs, a big part of this project was the research to figure out a model that would make sense mathematicaly, and be satisfying in terms of the aesthetics of the generated shapes.\n","date":"1 May 2023","permalink":"/projects/spirograph/","section":"Projects","summary":"A program to visualize spirographs using C++ and SFML","title":"Spirograph Visualizer"},{"content":"A 2D/3D game about conveyors and factories\nAn attempt at a serious game # This game was made on Unity with a team of six, over the course of three months for a class on serious games.\nWe were given a theme: demystify Artificial Intelligence\nThis inspired us to make this puzzle game, in this fictional universe, geometry is a business and the player must setup supply lines for their factory by placing conveyors and machines intelligently.\nThe 3D part of the game allow the player to walk around and select the stage they want to play by walking up to it, the main gameplay loop happens in the 2D sections, were the player can freely design their conveyor lines and using machines that paint, sort or reshape shapes.\nThis game, although unplayable as of now, was a good exercise in writing expandable code that would allow for a future person to design theyr own grid objects, machines, and conveyors.\nMy part of the work # I developped the grid system as well as the scripts that allow machines and conveyors to be highlighted, placed, destroyed etc.\nI also drew the sprites for the 2D sections of the game.\n","date":"1 May 2023","permalink":"/projects/formfinder/","section":"Projects","summary":"A 2D/3D game about conveyors and factories","title":"FormFinder"},{"content":"A Shoot\u0026rsquo;em up arcade game where you can convert enemies into friends\nA very personal project\u0026hellip; # Friend-Ship is my current passion project, as a huge fan of the shmup genre,\nI wanted to try my hand at making one.\rI have been working on this game for about 2 years in between classes, from the playable demo i made to the project it has become today, we are currently working on it as \u0026ldquo;whiteboard\u0026rdquo;, a team of 3 students as part of a class project at the UQAC (Université du Québec à Chicoutimi).\nAnd a challenge # Friend-Ship also proved to be a good challenge in terms of game design, programming, and art, the current project is being developped under the Unity engine, and we are working especially hard to ensure that our code allows as much freedom as possible in order to design exotic bullet patterns, ennemis, bosses etc.\nMy part of the work # Working on this game has forced me to develop new skills, namely in the art department, all sprites in the game so far (including the ennemies you can see on this page) were drawn and animated by me.\nI was also responsible for setting up the shooting system, which is one of the very core parts of any shoot\u0026rsquo;em up game, the current version of our system allows for some freedom for creating patterns, as seen in the early trailer we made.\nThis project is still very much in its early stage, but so far it has proved to be both a fun project, and a learning opportunity.
