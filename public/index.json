[{"content":" A very personal project\u0026hellip; # A Shoot\u0026rsquo;em up arcade game where you can convert enemies into friends.\nFriend-Ship is my current passion project, as a huge fan of the shmup genre,\nI wanted to try my hand at making one.\nI have been working on this game for about 2 years in between classes, from the playable demo i made to the project it has become today, we are currently working on it as \u0026ldquo;whiteboard\u0026rdquo;, a team of 3 students, as part of a class project at the UQAC (Université du Québec à Chicoutimi).\nAnd a challenge # Friend-Ship also proved to be a good challenge in terms of game design, programming, and art, the current project is being developped using the Unity engine, and we are working especially hard to ensure that our code allows as much freedom as possible in order to design exotic bullet patterns, ennemis, bosses etc.\nWe are proud to challenge ourselves with relatively high bars to clear in terms of aesthetics, programming, and fun value, we aim to release the game on steam somewhere in the forseeable future.\nMy part of the work # The bullet pattern system # I was also responsible for setting up the shooting system, which is one of the very core parts of any shoot\u0026rsquo;em up game, the current version of our system allows for some freedom for creating patterns, as seen in the trailer we made.\nThis task was a great opportunity for me to challenge both my math skills and my creativity to come up with challenging and exotic looking patterns.\nThe aesthetics # Working on this game has forced me to sharpen my skills, namely in the art department, all sprites in the game so far (including the ennemies you can see scattered around this page) were drawn and animated by me.\nWith the help of my team, I conceptialized, sketched, and animated a multitude of bullets, explosions and ennemies, they really bring flair to the game in a way i had never done before.\nLevel design # Designing the levels of the game is an undertaking we are tackling as a team, testing and conceptualizing the encounters that the player will have to overcome.\nIn terms of enemy design, making the bosses stand out a lot from standard ennemies was a priority, to provide a memorable boss-fighting experience.\nThis project is still very much in its early stage, but so far it has proved to be both a fun project, and a learning opportunity, i am very proud and thankful of my team. To conclude, here is the short trailer we made.\n# ","date":"15 May 2023","permalink":"/PortfolioAdamNASSIRI/projects/friend-ship/","section":"Projects","summary":"A very personal project\u0026hellip; # A Shoot\u0026rsquo;em up arcade game where you can convert enemies into friends.","title":"friend-ship"},{"content":"","date":"15 May 2023","permalink":"/PortfolioAdamNASSIRI/tags/game/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"game"},{"content":"","date":"15 May 2023","permalink":"/PortfolioAdamNASSIRI/tags/projects/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"15 May 2023","permalink":"/PortfolioAdamNASSIRI/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 May 2023","permalink":"/PortfolioAdamNASSIRI/tags/unity/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Unity"},{"content":"","date":"14 May 2023","permalink":"/PortfolioAdamNASSIRI/tags/c++/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"C++"},{"content":" My first \u0026ldquo;game\u0026rdquo; # As a team of two students, and over the course of six months, our goal was to make a program capable of visualizing spirographs using C++ and SFML\nThis program has some interactive features, although the actual building of the spirograph (the size and amount of discs) has to be done beforehand.\nWith this application, a user can setup their spirograph and watch it draw itself. all necessary information to use the program is detailed in the README.md file on the github repository.\nAdamWizard/Projet_Spirograph 4th year project C\u0026#43;\u0026#43; 3 2 It was my first experience with any kind of visual output software, we used SFML to render the shapes on a black background.\nMy part of the work # The math # I was in charge of defining and applying the equations that rule over the circular movement of the assembly, I deepened my mathematical skills, especially in the trigonometry department.\nSince we had no prior information about the math of spirographs, a big part of this project was the research to figure out a model that would both be mathematicaly correct, and produce aestheticaly pleasing shapes.\nThe class architecture # In addition to the basic math principles that govern the spirographs movement, I also conceptualized and developped the main classes that represent the spirograph itself, this has improved my understanding of C++ and object oriented code in general.\nConclusion # This project was a step up for me in terms of involvement, planning and teamwork.
